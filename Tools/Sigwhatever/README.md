Sigwhatever
For automated exploitation of netntlm hash capture via image tags in emails signatures. This targets Outlook specifically and will insert a 1x1px image into an existing signature block, or create a new signature as required. A listener is then started to capture authentication attempts that happen as a result of sent emails being viewed by other users.

The tool borrows code from the Seatbelt and Inveigh projects - features are:

* Queries the firewall for suitable ports to listen on (Uses some seatbelt code)
* Cross references HttpQueryServiceConfiguration for any usable URL ACLs
* TCP/HTTP server and hash capture (Uses Inveigh code)
* Signature Detection (to modify the appropriate registry settings and signatures)
* Modification of Signature
* Feature to send mail to specific group (e.g. domain admins)
* Option to create encrypted logs on disk
* Cleanup (Reverts changes in signature settings and existing signature)

==========

**TL DR:**

run:

**execute-assembly sigwhatever.exe AUTO**

Then when you're finished, run:

**execute-assembly sigwhatever.exe CLEANUP**

Bear in mind that even running jobkill on the .net job does not seem to kill the spawned process.

Usage: SigWhatever.exe [OPTIONS]+ operation


Options:
  -p, --port=VALUE           TCP Port.
  -l, --log=VALUE            Log file path.
  -g, --group=VALUE          Target Active Directory group.
  -f, --force                Force HTTP server start.
      --ba, --backdoor-all   Backdoor all signatures.
  -c, --challenge=VALUE      NTLM Challenge (in hex).
  -u, --url-prefix=VALUE     URL Prefix. e.g. /MDEServer/test
  -h, --help                 Show this message and exit.

Operations:
  AUTO: Just do everything for me - backdoor the signature and start the listener on this box.
  Usage: SigWhatever.exe AUTO

  CHECKTRUST: Check whether the trust zone settings - if the domain isn't in there then this probably won't work
  Usage: SigWhatever.exe CHECKTRUST

  CHECKFW: Check whether the host based firewall is on and whether there's an exception for the chosen port
  Usage: SigWhatever.exe CHECKFW -p <port>

  SIGNATURE: hijack the current user's signature, or add a new one via registry changes
  Usage: SigWhatever.exe SIGNATURE -p <port> -l <logfile> -u <url prefix> --backdoor-all --force

  SIGNOLISTEN: hijack the current user's signature, or add a new one via registry changes
  Usage: SigWhatever.exe SIGNOLISTEN -s <server> -p <port> -l <logfile> --backdoor-all>

  CLEANUP: Remove any modifications to the registry or htm signature files
  Usage: SigWhatever.exe CLEANUP

  EMAILADMINS: Enumerate email addresses from an AD group and send them a 'blank' email with the payload.
  Usage: SigWhatever.exe EMAILADMINS -g <Active Directory group> -p <port> -l <logfile> --force

  LISTENONLY: Just start the listener - make sure it's on the same port
  Usage: SigWhatever.exe LISTENONLY -p <port> -l <logfile>

  SHOWACLS: List all URL Reservation ACLs with User, Everyone or Authenticated Users permissions.
  Usage: SigWhatever.exe SHOWACLS

  NOTE: With the signature option, if --backdoor-all is not specified then the tool will attempt to get the current signature from Outlook - this may cause a popup for the user if their AV is out of date.
